# GAME NIGHT TRACKER

&#127922; Everything a modern board gamer needs besides games and players. &#x1f3b2;

---

As my first coded web application from scratch, i had to go for something that i feel could be useful to many gamers  
around the globe. Modern board gamers love to track their game nights and log e.g. their scores and play time, over the
course of their gaming "career" - which usually does not end, if you get bitten by the board game bug. Many people even
take it as a challenge and get motivated to play even more by tracking their stats. And while there are already a few
apps out there, i have been missing the **all-in-one solution** - one that follows the flow of the typical game
session... what, who, how long, results.

## Features

- User Login (using JWT)
- Automatic loading of existing sessions, games and players from database
- Adding new players with a randomized color property
- Animated randomizer for player order
- Timer for game duration including little animation
- Save action will automatically render the session on the first page
